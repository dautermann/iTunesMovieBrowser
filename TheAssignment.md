Duration: ~2 4 hours
Create search
an iOS universal application that allows user to search for movies using iTunes store
API. The app should:
* provide a movie search results list or grid view.
* each search result should show movie name, director, year, brief intro, and poster.
* show a detail view when a search result is selected, be creative with the display.
* allow user to favorite movies from search results.
* show all favorite movies in a second tab, and persist favorites across app launches.
* show favorite status in search results if a movie has been added to favorites.
* support all orientations on iPad and portrait only for iPhone.
* notify user when unable to perform a search.
* should be localized to English and another language of your choice for any interface
strings.

The project should be implemented in Objective­C. Swift may be used in supplement for extra credit. Both traditional memory management and/or ARC may be used. User interface may be created with Interface Builder or programmatically with auto layout. The constraints of mobile devices should be considered. All software development best practices should be employed, including tests. Please do NOT use non­Apple 3rd party libraries or any substantial 3rd party sources verbatim (cite the source of any insubstantial code taken from a 3rd party source). Please do NOT use a web view.

At the end of the exercise, please send us the project we can run in the simulator or on a device.
